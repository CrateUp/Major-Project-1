# GetInk'd

A website built to act as a portfolio and one stop shop for tattoo artists/studios to increase their visibility online.

Value added by allowing tattoo artists to showcase their work in a permanent platform that they have control over, versus the vast majority who rely on social media platforms that they have no hosting control over.

## User Stories
As the customer, I need to be able to see that there is a clear way to find the artist's previous work, what styles they are proficient in and the ability to contact them so I can easily enquire about their services as a tattoo artist.

## Built Using:

## Bugs and Fixes

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <p>1. The initial problem was that the image was completely distorted on mobile as it wasn't scaling correctly</p>
        <img src="readme/images/bug1/bug1_problem.png" alt="Distorted and improperly scaled header image" height="17.5%" width="17.5%">
    <p>2. To rectify this, I applied a class to the image and changed the height and object-fit properties so that the image would scale correctly in the boundaries</p>
